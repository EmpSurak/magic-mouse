Cast your way through 2.5D levels by drawing bridges with your mouse and hopping onto them.

An Overgrowth puzzle mod which makes use of the mouse.

### ToDo-List

- Add Mod menu to editor for settings
	- Reset PB on this map
	- Show hotspot short info on certain distance to not clutter the screen
- Remove PB reset from script parameters
- Overbright switches on which the mouse is hovering over?
- Export shared strings to shared.as?
- Switch Hotspot uses Reset() and runs before post_reset. Hook LevelMessages and wait for post_reset?
- Change Switch toggling to right click or modifier+left click?
